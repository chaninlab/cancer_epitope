This folder contains the R codes used for modelling of this study. 

4 different implementations are provided: 

(a) oversampling for multiple classes 
(b) oversampling for binary class
(c) undersampling for multiple classes 
(d) undersampling for binary class.

The 4 implementatons are provided because difference in algorithms for different classification instances were hardcoded without user selection interface as to simplify repeated code tests.

To run, only the R script needs to be started, nothing else needs to be done.

The 4 implementations provided accounts for all possible classification settings used in this study.

The inputfiles to the R scripts contains less descriptors than found in Supplementary S1 Descriptor Legends. This is due to the removal of descriptors with near zero variance done as a separate step from the main classification modelling.
